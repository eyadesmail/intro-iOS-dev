 a simple news application which reads feed data from 5 different sources depending on categories. 
 features include searching for news organizations around you, viewing news, opening news web pages and sharing a new news using the app on facebook and twitter. 
 the application's main goal is to be simplistic to allow for an easy reading of news. 
 i made it with this in mind; news around you is important to know and i never had the time or interest in reading news. 
 this app is supposed to give me a one stop news platform to get news from multiple areas.
